This elaborate platinum circle is carved with runes. It has nine charges, when there are no charges left in the circle, it crumbles to dust. You can take the Magic action to spend a charge and create one of the following 20-foot Emanations for 10 minutes:

***Quick Rest.*** Creatures staying within the emanation for the duration can gain the benefits of a Night’s Rest.

***Greater Rest.*** Creatures that are in the process of taking a Night’s Rest within the Emanation instead gain the benefits of a Good Rest at the end of the night.
