## Regional Map
On the regional map, one [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|hex]] is 3 miles across.
  
When the players enter a region worth exploring in detail, GMs might move them onto a new map: this is the regional map. This more granular approach allows you to break down travel and exploration into finer chunks. All travel on this scale is measured in hexes and hours.
**The main island map for the Eastmarch Expedition will use this style of maps.**

***No Fractions.*** There’s no such thing as traveling half a hex or for half an hour. You always move in whole increments.
***Create Features.*** For ideal results, *around half of the hexes* on a regional map should contain a feature of some kind. It doesn’t have to be a dungeon, but there might be landmarks, or other points of interest. This can be a useful tool for navigation and orientation when a party inevitably gets lost, or perhaps a clue to the location of a dungeon. Check [[Creating a Regional Map]] for more info.
***Mounted Travel.*** A party on horseback moves twice as fast when entering a road, plains or hills hex.

> A distance of 3 miles can be referred to as a League. By referring to your hexes as leagues, the players and GM can give themselves a way to talk about hexes in character.

### Entering a Hex
Travel along the regional map begins by leaving your current [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|hex]] and entering an adjacent [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|hex]].

#### Determining Time
How long it takes to enter a hex is determined by the hex’s terrain type. See the [[Hexes by Type]] table.

#### Navigating the Wilderness
To enter a forest, swamp, or mountain [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|hex]], the player *leading* the party’s exploration must make a navigation check. This is usually a Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check, but it could be any other skill the GM deems to be relevant.

***Setting the DC.*** The GM determines the check’s difficulty class by selecting a number between 10 and 20 based on the surrounding hexes.
If the adjacent hexes all share the same terrain type, you can make the check more difficult by increasing the DC.
If landmarks are visible, you can make the check easier by reducing the DC.
***Automatic Success.*** When the party is travelling along a reliable route, like following a river, you could chose to have the player *automatically succeed* any checks made.

#### Inside the Hex
When the party enters a hex, they learn the following things:

- The terrain and features of this hex.
- The terrain of adjacent hexes.
- Features in adjacent hexes that would be visible from a distance, such as structures.
- Whether or there is obviously something to discover here by searching this hex.

#### Trailblaze
Once you’ve entered a hex by making a successful navigation check, you automatically succeed on all future navigation checks made to enter that hex.
In a West March campaign such as the Eastmarch Expedition, assume that if the [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|hex]] has been previously explored by any party, this rule applies.

#### Getting Lost
When a player fails a navigation check, they lead the party into an adjacent hex before realizing that they’re lost. 
While lost, the party can continue travelling but the GM should not confirm their location on the map again until they’ve confidently reoriented themselves by navigating to a previously explored hex or a known feature, or by some other means the GM deems appropriate.

### Searching a hex
To search a hex, the party spends time determined by the Hex’s Type, see the [[Hexes by Type]] table. When the search is completed, the party learns about any hidden features present in the hex.

### Wilderness Day
A full 24-hour day in the wilderness generally consists of the following phases.

***Rolling for Weather.*** The GM rolls for weather and determines any applicable modifiers to the day’s checks.

***Exploring.*** The party spends 8 hours traveling between hexes, resolving encounters and exploring features.

***Camping.*** The party spends four hours setting up camp at their destination, relaxing, unwinding, and planning their next day. During this phase, every character must consume one ration or an equivalent amount of food.

***Rest.*** Every character rests for 8 hours.

***Downtime.*** Any unused hours can be used in-between the other phases for downtime activities.

#### Forced March
Whenever a party finishes entering or searching a hex, if they have spent more than 8 hours exploring that day, tally up the additional hours spent and ask each character in the party to make a marching check.

***Marching Checks.*** *Constitution Saving Throw*: DC 10 + 1 for each hour spent past 8. Each character that fails suffers one level of [[Exhaustion|exhaustion]].
