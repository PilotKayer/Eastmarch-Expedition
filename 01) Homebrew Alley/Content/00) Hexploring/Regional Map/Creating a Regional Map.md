### Creating a Regional Map
To create and use a regional map, start with a simple grid of hexes. Choose a terrain type for each hex, fill around half the hexes with some features, then do as much decorating as you want. This will be the GM’s version of the regional map.

***Features.*** A feature could be a settlement, a ruin, a dungeon, or just a point of interest. Make a simple list of ideas to start, then create more detailed content your players explore closer.

***Terrain.*** A terrain denotes how tricky the hex is to explore. The terrain types are forest, swamp, mountain, plains, or hills hex.

#### The Empty Map
Once the GM has created their version of the regional map with all the details, they can then create a second version with only obvious or known landmarks drawn in. These could be mountains or large monuments that are either common knowledge or just visible from a distance.
The GM then leaves all the other hexes blank for their players to discover.

#### Filling in the Map
As players explore the wilderness, they’ll draw their own version of the regional map by filling in the empty hexes they’ve explored with their own symbols for features and terrains.

This process will inevitably inspire more play, as most players tend to find filling in the map to be a deeply satisfying experience.
