# Hexploration

> By layering a hex grid over a map you’ve created, you can convert distances into measurements of time. This allows you, the GM, to quickly determine how long any given journey will take.
> When players ask how far they are from their destination, you can simply count the hexes.

Hexploration is a simple ruleset to run hexcrawls in 5th Edition. In here you’ll find guidance on [[World Map|World Maps]], [[Regional Map|Regional Maps]], Exploring Hexes, Downtime Jobs, Rolling for Weather, and Rolling for Random Encounters.

#### The Two Scales
In Hexploration, maps are sorted into two categories of scale:

* World maps have 24-mile hexes.
* Regional maps have 3-mile hexes.

#### Travel Speed
Regardless of the map scale, a character or a party of characters, traveling on foot in ideal conditions, can move at a speed of up to 3 miles per hour, or a total of 24 miles over an 8-hour day.
