#### Night’s Rest
When you finish a night’s rest, you gain the following benefits:

***Spend Hit Point Dice.*** You can spend one or more of your hit point dice to regain hit points. For each hit point die you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1 hit point). You can decide to spend an additional hit point die after each roll.

***Special Feature.*** If you have a feature that recharges or interacts with a [[short rest]], it recharges  or interacts in the way specified in its description.
