***Ability Scores Restored.*** If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal.

***Exhaustion Reduced.*** If you have the [[exhaustion]] condition, its level decreases by 1.

***Special Feature.*** If you have a feature that recharges or interacts with a [[long rest]], it recharges  or interacts in the way specified in its description.
