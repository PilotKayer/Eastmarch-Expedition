### Excursion Resting
Excursion resting is the alternative set of resting rules. The following rules replace the [[Short Rest]] and [[Long Rest]] rules in the Rules Glossary.

#### Taking A Rest
A rest is a period of extended downtime - at least 8 hours - available to any creature. During a Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as *reading*, *talking*, *eating*, or *standing watch*. During sleep, you are [[unconscious]]. *After you finish a rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one.*

***Interrupting the Rest.*** Any rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage

You can resume a rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.

***Benefits of the Rest.*** The benefits of the rest change depending on if it was a [[Night's Rest|night’s rest]] or a [[Good Rest|good rest]]. Additionally, there are [[Safe Haven|safe havens]] as well as [[Relaxing|relaxing]] rules.

#### Holy Days
Magic Items that recharge on dawn instead recharge on the dawn of the next Sunday.

#### Knocking Out A Creature
When you would reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 hit point and give it the unconscious condition. The creature loses the condition in 1d4 hours.

#### Sanctuary
If you leave a ritual offering of 100 gold pieces at an active Sanctuary, you can take a night’s rest there in 10 minutes instead of a whole night.
