### Random Weather
While exploring, the weather can have a huge effect on how progress is made day-to-day. Use the following tables to introduce random weather by the seasons.

***What are these months?*** These random weather tables are based off of the Orethon calendar. Which starts in Springsdawn and ends in Wintersdusk. You can rename the tables to fit your own campaign setting, or use these as written.

***How to read the tables.*** The weather determines the effect on the Navigation Checks and Marching Checks made in the Regional Map section. 

***Advantage and Disadvantage.*** (A) means you have advantage on the listed checks, whereas (D) means you have disadvantage on the listed checks.

***Not all months are equal.*** As you would expect, the weather in some months make exploration more difficult. Parties may want to limit their exploration to the more convenient months.

***Weather as Damage.*** In extreme weather, GMs might rule that party staying o vernight on a mountainside in cold tempertures, or in a clearing in blistering winds takes 1d6 cold damage when they finish their rest.
