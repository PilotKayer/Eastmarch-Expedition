#### Other Activity
You can spend your downtime doing another activity, such as scouting ahead, setting up traps or bells to reduce the chance of a [[Random Encounters|random encounter]]. You could also use this downtime for activities built into your class, such as a wizard writing new spells in their spellbook, or scribing scrolls.
