#### Forage for Food
You spend *four hours* foraging. Roll a Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check. A result of 10 provides you with enough food to forego the use of one ration today. Each increment of 5 above that allows you to forego an additional ration. You can spend two hours foraging instead. If you do, make the check with disadvantage.
