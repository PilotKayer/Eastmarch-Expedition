#### Craft a Healing Potion
You spend *four hours* creating a potion. You grind a [[Honeymint Herb]] into powder with a mortar and pestle and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check. *On a success:* you create a Potion of Healing. *On a failure:* you lose the [[Honeymint Herb]] used.
You also need Water and a container (such as a flask) to store the [[Potion of Healing]].
