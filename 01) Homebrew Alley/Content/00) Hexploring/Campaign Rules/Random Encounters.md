### Random Encounters 
At the start of the day, the GM rolls for random encounters by rolling a d6. 

***In the Wilderness.*** On a 6, the GM rolls on the Random Encounter Table.

***In Dangerous Areas.*** On a roll of a 5 or a 6, the GM rolls on the Random Encounter Table.

***In a Treacherous Area.*** On a roll of a 4, 5, or 6, the GM rolls on the Random Encounter Table.

#### Building a Random Encounter Table
GMs should build a random encounter table by listing types of encounters on one side and the results of a die roll on the other. Below is a Random Encounter Table for a gothic horror setting. You could use it as reference for how to build your own table for your own wilderness. You create an entry for each encounter which outlines how the encounter could be used as an encounter for simple combat, deadly combat, exploration, or dialogue.

#### Using Random Encounter Table
Rolling on a random encounter table, a GM uses the result as an inspiration for what happens next, not as a directive. For example, the result for a roll of a 6  is Wolves, the GM might write the following notes to themselves to outline possible outcomes of a random wolf encounter.

#### 6. Wolves.
A wolfpack circles the camp and charges the characters if they think they can take them on. Each of the beasts bears the singed mark of Strahd on their paws, indicating his control over the beasts.

The pack consists mostly of wolves, but there might be some dire wolves, or a werewolf pack leader. If the party is particularly high level, consider adding a dire worg!

Alternatively, they might find a single wounded wolf pup. A character could, with a successful DC 18 Animal Handling check, spend a ration to endear the wolf to themselves. This might lead to the wolf becoming a sidekick!

#### Updating the Table
The GM could choose to change and update the table depending on the region the characters are travelling through to make sure the results always include fun, exciting, and fitting options.
