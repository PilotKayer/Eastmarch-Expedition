A ***Hex*** is a location on the world map. It is 3 miles long (or 1 league) and requires 1 hour of travel. This is unless the ***Hex*** is occupied by a forest, hill, mountain, lake, or other features.
When the party enters a hex, they learn the following things:

- The terrain and features of this hex.
- The terrain of adjacent hexes.
- Features in adjacent hexes that would be visible from a distance, such as structures.
- Whether or there is obviously something to discover here by searching this hex.
