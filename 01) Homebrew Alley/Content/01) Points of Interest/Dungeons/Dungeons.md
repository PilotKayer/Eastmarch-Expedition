# Dungeons
Dungeons are any linear experience that contains one or more *rooms*. These *rooms* don't have to be actual rooms, made of stone brick with vaulted ceilings. They are a concept of rooms, and can be from a set of clearings in a forest, to rooms of a house. The idea of a dungeon is simply expressed to create linear play content that contains secrets and loot without a complete focus on role-play. With that being said, it is fully possible that the only way to clear a dungeon is to talk nicely to BBEG residing in it.

## Formatting a Dungeon
Dungeons for the **Eastmarch Expedition** follow a 5-room layout as described by [Dadi from Mystic Arts](https://www.youtube.com/@Dadi-MysticArts) in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pB-KR_u15o):
- The Entrance
- The Puzzle
- The Setback
- The Climax
- The Resolution

## Dungeon Template
If you want a base structure for a dungeon with the 5-room layout already prepared, copy the [[1. Dungeon Template| template]] and modify it.
