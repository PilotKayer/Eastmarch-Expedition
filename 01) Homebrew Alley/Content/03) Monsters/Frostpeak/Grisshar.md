## Lore
Born through magical rites involving the essences of dragons, half-dragons serve their creators and their own draconic whims. Most half-dragons are created by chromatic dragons who desire servants with some trace of their own might and grandeur. Half-dragons frequently command other servants of a villainous dragon or act as agents in lands where their draconic master would attract unwanted attention.  
Half-dragons share personality traits and agendas with the dragon who spawned them. Those resembling chromatic dragons typically loathe their creator even as they seek the same ends. Half-dragons with the traits of metallic dragons are especially rare, but they might arise through magical accidents, the efforts of reckless magic-users, or the last act of a dying dragon.
